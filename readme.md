# Sample 1 - SimpleChatList

When I tried to make a UI like this, I faced a problem. When keyboard appears, TableView doesn't scroll automatically. I wanted to make the feature tableview scrolls automatically so I tried to make this project. Below images describe the difference without feature and with feature properly.

I created two ViewControllers because I wanted to implement this using two ways. You can understand major difference with images below.
